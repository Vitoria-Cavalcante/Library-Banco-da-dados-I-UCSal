Here is a simple relational model of this database project

The goal of this project was to create a library database that goes beyond a simple data storage system by incorporating constraints and triggers, allowing me to apply concepts learned during the semester (2023.1). This database includes unique features that address real-world scenarios, such as lending restrictions and automatic notifications for inactivity. Key functionalities include:

Preventing Double Lending: Books already marked as lent cannot be lent out again until returned.
Age Restrictions: Books designated as suitable for ages 18+ cannot be checked out by users under 18.
Inactivity Notifications: Books that haven’t been borrowed for six months will prompt a notification for deletion or lending action.
This setup aims to simulate a dynamic library system with essential rules for managing the circulation and availability of books, making it a useful learning experience in database constraints and trigger-based automations.

Here are some examples of search I've been doing while coding (and after done):
